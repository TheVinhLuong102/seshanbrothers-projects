**M3MORY GAM3:** An electronic version of the popular memory game built using EV3s. This is a multi-EV3 project that involves rotating titles. Players have to remember where they saw a particular LEGO piece and then turn the correct tiles to create a match. The game board can be replaced with new tiles when needed.

**M3LODY MAKER:** A musical robot. This EV3 uses the color sensor to read long strips of paper with notes on them. Each color corresponds to a note.

**DROIDBOT JR:** A training robot built with parts from the 31313 set for use with all our lessons on EV3Lessons.com

**DROIDBOT 2.0:** A training robot built designed to be used with all the lessons on EV3Lessons.com
