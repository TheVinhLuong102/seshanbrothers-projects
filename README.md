**PIX3L PLOTT3R:** A dot-matrix printer built using LEGO Mindstorms EV3. There are many different versions of this project. Some are programmed in Python, but most are programmed in EV3-G. Some require LEGO Markers, but others are designed for readily available markers. SCRIB3 is made with just one 31313 set. Choose the project that fits your needs.  <a href="https://github.com/seshanbrothers/projects/tree/master/PIX3LPLOTT3R"> Project Files </a>

**EV3D Pi.G Print3r:** A LEGO MINDSTORMS 3D Printer that uses an inexpensive 3D printing pen. This printer accepts G-Code files.  The EV3 is programmed in standard EV3-G. Pre-processing of the G-Code is done in Python. *Project files coming soon*

**COLOR CATCH3R:** A LEGO MINDSTORMS multiplayer game. *Project files coming soon*

**M3MORY GAM3:** An electronic version of the popular memory game built using EV3s. This is a multi-EV3 project that involves rotating titles. Players have to remember where they saw a particular LEGO piece and then turn the correct tiles to create a match. The game board can be replaced with new tiles when needed.    <a href="https://github.com/seshanbrothers/projects/blob/master/MemoryGame/EV3Memory.ev3"> Code File </a> 

**VOT3R Booth:** An electronic voting booth.<a href="https://github.com/seshanbrothers/projects/blob/master/Vot3rBooth/VotingEV3.ev3"> Code File V.1 </a>, <a href="https://github.com/seshanbrothers/projects/blob/master/Vot3rBooth/Icecream.ev3"> Code File V.2 (Icecream) </a> 

**M3LODY MAKER:** A musical robot. This EV3 uses the color sensor to read long strips of paper with notes on them. Each color corresponds to a note. <a href="https://github.com/seshanbrothers/projects/blob/master/Vot3rBooth/VotingEV3.ev3"> Code File V.1 </a>

**DROIDBOT JR:** A training robot built with parts from the 31313 set for use with all our lessons on EV3Lessons.com. <a href="http://ev3lessons.com/robots/DroidJR.lxf"> LDD </a>

**DROIDBOT 2.0:** A training robot built designed to be used with all the lessons on EV3Lessons.com. <a href="http://ev3lessons.com/robots/droidbot2.lxf"> LDD </a>
