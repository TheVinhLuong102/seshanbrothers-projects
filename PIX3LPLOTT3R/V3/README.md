You are welcome to reproduce or improve upon this project for your own, non-commercial use.  Please credit Sanjay and Arvind Seshan for the original design and code.

# Version 3.0 Features
1. Uses regular, thin markers (e.g. Crayola, Prang, or equivalent think line marker)
2. Programmed in EV3-G
3. Additional images processed in Python (if neeeded)
4. Parts needed: 1 EV3 brick, 2 medium motors, 1 large motor, 1 color sensor, extra Technic and System parts
5. Paper: This robot has been designed for US Letter Head size. You will have to make modifications if your paper is different
6. Plastic sheet: We recommend that you place a plastic sheet on top of the plates for the paper to rest on. Tape the plastic sheet down at one end (where the color sensor is located). This will prevent the paper from catching on the holes in the LEGO.

# Installation Steps

**STEP 1:** Build the robot. This robot requires parts beyond a single EV3 set. Although there are no build instructions provided, you can use the LDD file to duplicate this design. Use the hide and reveal features as needed. You will notice that there is a dark plate under the color sensor. This is deliberate.

**STEP 2:** Download the main code. The code is in the .ev3 file. You will need to download this and the .rtf files to the brick. If you don't know how to do that, refer to EV3Lessons.com.

**STEP 3:** How does it work? There is a menu system that displays on the brick that lets you pick from the two images. You can use the left and right brick buttons to preview the image.

**STEP 4:** How do you make more images? We have provided a Python script that will convert any png to a rtf. The png should be 100 pixels width.
