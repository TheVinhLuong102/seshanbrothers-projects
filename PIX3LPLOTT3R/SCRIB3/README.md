Step 1: Build Model

Step 2: Tape a large piece of paper donn on a hard surface.

Step 2: Add Pen into Pen Holder. Insert pen as shown and secure with LEGO rubberband. Adjust the hold of the pen holder (light green circles) by removing extra LEGO pieces or moving the top of the holder to the right as needed for your pen. You will know that you pen is in the right location if you can move the gear (marked in red) and the pen nip just touches the paper and leaves a dot. Test in one corner of your paper or on a scrap paper.

Step 3: Adjust Code. We have created many different images you can choose from. We have set up the code to have four images at a time. The default images in the code are: A photo of the Seshan Brothers who created this project, the Taj Mahal, MINDSTORMS Expert Marc-Andre Bazergui and XX.  You can either print one of those four, or upload your own images and modify the code.  Note: To create alternative images in a format that is recognized by the EV3, you will have to run a small Python Script.

Step 4: Download the four images to Brick. See EV3Lessons.com --> Advanced --> Files if you do not know how to add the images to the brick.

Step 5: Run the SCRIB3 Program. Now use the IR Beacon Remote buttons to pick the images. Each button corresponds to an image.
