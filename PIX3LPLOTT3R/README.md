PIX3L PLOTT3R is a series of printing robots made with LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3s. Different versions provide different features. Some feature a paper feeder, some feature LEGO markers, some feature multiple EV3s working together and some can even be built with just one set. Each version has a different print mechanism. We will share the project build and code files for each version here. Build the one that best fits your needs or build them all!
