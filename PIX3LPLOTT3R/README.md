You are welcome to reproduce or improve on any of these project for your own, non-commercial use.  Please credit Sanjay and Arvind Seshan for the original design and code.

PIX3L PLOTT3R is a series of printing robots made with LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3s. Different versions provide different features. Some feature a paper feeder, some feature LEGO markers, some feature multiple EV3s working together and some can even be built with just one set. Each version has a different print mechanism. We will share the project build and code files for each version here. Build the one that best fits your needs or build them all!

**PIX3L PLOTT3R 2.0 EV3-Dev Edition:** This Plotter is programmed entirely in Python. It will require you to understand EV3-Dev (www.ev3dev.org) and Python.

**PIX3L PLOTT3R 3.0:** Has a paper feeder and uses regular, fine line markers.
